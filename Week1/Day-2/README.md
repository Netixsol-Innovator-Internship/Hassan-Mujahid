### What I learned

I have learnt a name giving technique commonly named as BEM(Block Element Modifier) in css, which is a naming convention for CSS class names that helps to maintain a clear and consistent structure in a project's styling, and also have learnt the use of flexbox and how it works.

```css
..card__qr-code {
  padding: 1rem;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

.card__qr-code > img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
  border-radius: 10px;
}

.card {
  background-color: #fff;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  text-align: center;
  max-width: 300px;
  border-radius: 1rem;
}
```
